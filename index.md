## IDEA

In an ideal world for ecological modellers, we would all use the same building blocks (subroutines) to develop our models. These building blocks would be collected in an open repository where they could undergo peer-review and testing. In this ideal world, ecological modelling would not use a repetitive workflow where the same thing is developed over and over again.

To get to this point, the YoMos (Young Modelleres in Ecology), a working group of the GfÖ, thought of initializing this idea by creating a public repository on github, which could be used to collect such subroutines. If successful, this repository can be integrated in a database to make it searchable and have a more user friendly interface. The github repository itself with issues and all its other features can be used to establish a peer-review workflow.

### Subroutines
“In computer programming, a subroutine is a sequence of program instructions that perform a specific task, packaged as a unit. This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particular task should be performed.” (Wikipedia article on subroutines)

Without the consideration of specific parameterizations, general routines in ecology should behave the same regardless of their area of application. For example, if an animal performs a random walk, the random walk of a different animal occurring in a different location should be the same – only differing in its parameterization. These general blocks of ecological modelling are hence reusable, but seldom shared or widely re-implemented in different models.

In our view every, an interesting subroutine could for example be one of the following:

Ideally, these subroutines would be available in several programming languages. A good example of such a library is probably http://rosettacode.org, where ”the  idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible”. This would allow us to take advantage of certain aspects of different programming languages and finally, we would not exclude people modelling in non-mainstream languages. 

### But why?

- To not reinvent the wheel: often we need to include a process in the model that is common in ecology and was already implemented in at least one other model. Examples of such processes: foraging behavior, movement / dispersal of individuals, mate choice, habitat selection etc.  
- To contribute to making ecology a discipline that allows for generalizations and hence has higher predictive power 
- To counteract the view of some (or many?) that agent-based modelling is an ad-hoc process. If we could reuse the building blocks of existing models (or the rationale behind their code), we would demonstrate that we (1) do not construct submodules according to our ‘feeling’; (2) rely on the submodules that were previously tested, verified and successfully used.



## AGENDA

We plan to organize a hackathon a day before the joint BES + GfÖ + NecoV and EEF Workshop in December, 2017.
It will be filled with hacking anything related to the fields we mentioned in the subroutine section, but it is like Vegas - where anything can happen. The hackathon is completely open; we welcome both seasoned and new developers, as well as people working in the field of ecological modelling that only want to contribute ideas. We especially want to have a wide variety of programming languages there, so even if you’re just using NetLogo – join us ;)

The general idea of this event is it to create a starting place for the modelling catalogue; to fill it with live so that it becomes attractive for people to use, spread and further develop.
If you want to participate, please mail to:

… and we keep you updated and include you in future planning ☺
